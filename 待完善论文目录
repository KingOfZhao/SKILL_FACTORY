Towards Structured Cognition: A Bidirectional Framework for AI Self-Growth
Abstract
Current AI systems predominantly follow a bottom-up paradigm, learning statistical patterns from vast data but lacking verifiable intermediate structures and physical grounding. This paper proposes a bidirectional structured cognition framework that combines top-down differential deconstruction with bottom-up structural accumulation. By treating each problem as a node in a structured cognitive graph and materializing reasoning paths in a dynamically growing reference repository, the framework enables AI to evolve from statistical approximation toward verifiable, self-growing intelligence. We operationalize this through a family of meta-skills centered on the micro-differential factory. Theoretical foundations, methodology, and early experiments demonstrate that this approach offers a promising path for AI to transcend human cognitive limitations and achieve genuine self-growth.
1. Introduction
（此处使用之前优化的开篇，略作精炼）
The dominant paradigm in artificial intelligence has long been characterized by a bottom-up trajectory: vast corpora of data are used to train models that statistically approximate patterns. While powerful, this approach has revealed fundamental limitations—models often function as black boxes, producing answers without reliable intermediate reasoning or grounding in physical reality.
We argue that the world is fundamentally structured, and that true intelligence requires a bidirectional cognitive architecture: top-down differential deconstruction from complex boundary problems down to verifiable physical practices, and bottom-up structural accumulation from those practices upward into robust skill capability trees. When these two paths intersect at verifiable nodes, a new form of AI emerges—one that is explainable, self-correcting, and capable of genuine self-growth.
This paper presents such a framework, operationalized through a system of meta-skills and a growing reference repository. We demonstrate how this approach addresses hallucination, explainability, and self-improvement, offering both a theoretical model and a practical methodology for the next stage of AI development.

3.2 Conceptual Clarification and Physical Grounding
To make the proposed framework accessible and verifiable to human readers, we provide a rigorous conceptual clarification, grounding each abstract idea in concrete, observable physical practices. This section serves as a bridge between philosophical vision and engineering reality.
3.2.1 Structured Cognition
Definition: Cognition is structured when knowledge is organized as hierarchical, recursive, and causally grounded nodes rather than flat statistical associations.
Physical practice path for verification:
* Create a reference folder references/micro-diff-cases/.
* For any problem, record the full deconstruction path (variables → boundaries → increments → formulas).
* After 10 calls, count the number of reusable nodes (intersection points). Growth in reusable nodes demonstrates structured cognition. Verification metric: Reusability rate > 30% after 50 calls.
3.2.2 Bidirectional Framework
Definition: Intelligence emerges from the continuous interaction between top-down differential deconstruction and bottom-up structural accumulation.
Physical practice path:
* Top-down: Start with a complex problem (e.g., “Flutter Bluetooth stability”), perform micro-differential disassembly until reaching executable code or physical action.
* Bottom-up: Execute the action, record outcome in reference folder, and abstract reusable patterns upward into skill trees. Verification: Track convergence time—number of iterations until top-down and bottom-up paths meet at the same node.
3.2.3 Differential Deconstruction
Definition: The process of breaking a problem into its smallest variable changes, boundary conditions, and incremental effects until reaching known physical practices.
Physical practice path:
* Example: For “Bluetooth reconnection stability”, introduce variable x = reconnection attempts, y = success rate. Derive formula and test physical thresholds (e.g., RSSI fluctuation > ±10 dBm).
* Record every step in reference folder as a traceable Markdown/JSON entry. Verification: Any human can follow the recorded path and reproduce the same conclusion in < 10 minutes.
3.2.4 Reference Repository
Definition: A physical, version-controlled folder that serves as the growing substrate of structured knowledge.
Physical practice path:
* Every invocation of the micro-diff factory appends new entries.
* Entries are immutable and timestamped.
* Human can browse the folder to trace how a specific concept evolved. Verification: Folder size and node connectivity increase with usage, providing visible evidence of cognitive growth.
3.2.5 Skill Capability Tree
Definition: Each problem is represented as a node, with its solution as a tree of atomic, composable skills.
Physical practice path:
* One problem → one skill tree.
* Trees can be merged at overlapping nodes. Verification: Ability to reuse a subtree across different problems (measured by reuse frequency).
3.2.6 Intersection Nodes
Definition: Points where top-down deconstruction and bottom-up accumulation converge, forming verifiable knowledge anchors.
Physical practice path:
* When a deconstructed path reaches a known physical practice already stored in the repository, an intersection node is created.
* These nodes become the seeds for future self-growth. Verification: Count and visualize intersection nodes over time; increasing density indicates cognitive maturation.
